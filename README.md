Roundcubemail Docker Dev
========================

A makeshift container image to easily run Roundcubemail from its repository code.

This image expects to be run with Roundcubemail's repository code mounted to `/var/www/html`, and prepares it to be runnable.

Principially this probably should be facilitated by the Roundcube-repo itself, but as long as that doesn't happen, this image helps.
